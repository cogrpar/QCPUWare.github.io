# Welcome to QCPU-Ware Documentation

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 What is QCPU-Ware?
QCPU-Ware is software that allows users to solve problems on a quantum computer without needing to know anything about quantum computers.  QCPU-Ware is built on D-Wave Systems' Leap Ocean-SDK (https://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap).  QCPU-Ware takes the Ocean-SDK and makes the entire development process much more user-friendly.  QCPU-Ware provides the user with simple and easy to use tools to formulate problems to be solved on the D-Wave quantum computers.  By using the QCPU-Ware Java library, users can define real-world problems to be solved on the D-Wave System like never before.  They can do all of this without needing to know anything about how quantum computing works.

### 1.2 What is a QCPU?
QCPU-Ware stands for "Quantum Converter Processing Unit softWare".  A Quantum Converter Processing Unit is a device that converts a problem specified by the user, into a problem that a quantum computer can solve.  The advantage of using a QCPU is that it allows the user to formulate problems without needing to know exactly how quantum computers work.  This also eliminates the need for the user to know how to formulate problems for the quantum computer.  This, in turn, makes coding on a quantum computer much easier, and available to people with any level of coding experience.   QCPU-Ware allows any Debian Linux based system (E.g. a Raspberry Pi) to be used as a QCPU.


## 2. How QCPU-Ware Works
### 2.1 QCPU
QCPU-Ware allows the user to set up a QCPU on any device running Debian based Linux (some popular debian based Linux distros are Ubuntu, Raspbian, Zorin os, and Kali Linux.  To get a complete list, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Debian-based_distributions).  A QCPU can be set up
