<blockquote>⚠️<b>  IMPORTANT:</b>  Before you can run the QCPU setup script, you will need to create a <a href="https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/signup/" target="_blank">D-Wave Leap account</a>.  This account gives you access to the D-Wave quantum computers, and your QCPU will need some of your account information to be able to connect to the quantum systems.  Once you have created your D-Wave leap account, you can move on to running the QCPU setup script.
