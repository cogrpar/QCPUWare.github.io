<blockquote>⚠️<b>  IMPORTANT:</b>  Keep in mind that unless you <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/study/manually-set-ip-linux/">set a static IP address on your QCPU</a>, or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22730420/how-to-configure-apache-webserver-to-be-accessed-by-public-domain-or-static-ip">use a public IP with port forwarding on your QCPU</a>, then you will need to use your QCPU's private IP address to connect to the server.  Private IP addresses are not static, meaning that they may change from time to time, and from network to network.  Get into the habit of checking your QCPU's private IP address every time you use it to ensure that your primary device can connect to the server.
